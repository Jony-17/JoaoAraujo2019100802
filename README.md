Portfolio initially designed in Figma which would later be transported to the web. Use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages, however halfway through the process I started using SCSS in order to improve my skills. The idea is to redo the Portfolio however, essentially using ReactJS and Tailwind.

🚧 In progress
